# Unreleased

This release is a complete rewrite of Spin.

Since the beginning of the project, a lot of learnings have been made and this new version incorporates these learning to build a solid foundation for the future of Spin.

- Documentation of the CLI, template DSL and template engine.
- Better man page documentation
- Calling `spin` without a subcommand now displays a simpler usage documentation. The `man` page is available with `spin --help`
- The CLI now provides a verbose flag to increase the verbosity
- New template DSL
- Template extension
- Better error messages
- Improvements of the configuration prompts using Inquire
- Update native templates to follow best practices (e.g. name of libraries)
- Versionning of the templates
- Bucklescript templates now fallback to using `npm` when `yarn` is absent
- Windows is now supported
- The official templates are now embedded. No need to download a git repository, and the project generation works offline.

# 0.5.1 - 2020-03-17

## Added

- Add versionning for the official templates to ensure updates on the templates don't break old version of Spin.

- Extract the Contributing section of the README to a CONTRIBUTING.md file.
- Add a CHANGES.md file that complies with dune-release requirements.
- Use dune-release in the release scripts.
- Remove homebrew Formula from the cli template that was a bad practice and didnâ€™t allow users to update the generated projects.
- Enable Windows in CI/CD of generated projects
