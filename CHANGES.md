# Unreleased

## Added

- Added a `parse_binaries` stanza that can be `true` to force Spin to parse binary files
- Added a `raw_files` stanza that takes a list of file or glob expressions to instruct Spin to copy files instead of parsing them

## Changed

- The `spa` template has been removed from the official templates and now lives at https://github.com/tmattio/spin-incr-dom
- Spin does not parse binary files by default anymore, they are simply copied to the destination folder
- Use `test` stanza for unit tests now that Alcotest prints colors by default
- Remove unused flags defined in the root's `dune` file

## Fixes

- The project generation will now fail before the configurations prompt if the output directory is not empty
- By default, Spin now creates a local switch for the generated projects. This can be changed with `spin config`, or by setting the env variable `SPIN_CREATE_SWITCH=false`
