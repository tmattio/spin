; This defines some global environment configuration for Dune.
; Here, we add some compiler flags in development to add warnings
; on compilation, and fail the compilation when there are warnings.
; If you want to deactivate some warning or error, you can add them
; here, for instance `-w +A-48-42-44-4` will deactivate warning 4 in
; addition to the ones already listed.
