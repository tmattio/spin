; Define a library named `hello` for our project.
; The library does not have any dependency, so only the standard library
; will be available in the modules of the `lib/` directory.
;
; Note that when a module with the same name as the library is defined,
; it will be used as the top-level of our library. If it's not the case,
; all of the modules in the directory will be exposed in a generated top-level.
