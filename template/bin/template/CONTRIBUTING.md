## Setup your development environment

{% if package_manager == 'Esy' -%}
You need Esy, you can install the latest version from [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```bash
yarn global add esy@latest
# Or
npm install -g esy@latest
```

Then run the `esy` command from this project root to install and build depenencies.

```bash
esy
```

This project uses [Dune](https://dune.build/) as a build system, if you add a dependency in your `package.json` file, don't forget to add it to your `dune` and `dune-project` files too.
{%- else -%}
You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can install the dependencies in a new local switch with:

```bash
make switch
```

Or globally, with:

```bash
make deps
```

Then, build the project with:

```bash
make build
```
{%- endif %}

### Running Binary

After building the project, you can run the main binary that is produced.

{% if package_manager == 'Esy' -%}
```bash
esy start
```
{%- else %}
```bash
make start
```
{%- endif %}

### Running Tests

You can run the test compiled executable:

{% if package_manager == 'Esy' -%}

```bash
esy test
```
{%- else %}
```bash
make test
```
{%- endif %}

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

{% if package_manager == 'Esy' -%}
```bash
esy doc
open-cli $(esy doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(esy doc-path)`
{%- else %}
```bash
make doc
open-cli $(make doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(make doc-path)`
